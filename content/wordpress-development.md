I have been building websites in WordPress for the past 8 years. In that time, I have built sites for small businesses to Fortune 1000 companies alike. I am also a subject matter expert on WordPress and have been published on popular WordPress publications Tuts+ and Torque Magazine and I have spoken at several meetups such as SEO Grail Philadelphia and Front End Philly.

# WordPress Development Services I Offer

I offer wide range of services for WordPress. This isn’t an exhaustive list, but this is a good example of my overall capabilities.

## Custom Theme Development

A theme controls the look and feel of your website making it one of the most important components. All custom themes that I build are of the highest quality, and look great on mobile devices.

## Custom Plugin Development

Plugins allow you to extend WordPress’s functionality outside of it’s core feature set. I have built plugins for clients that do things like create custom form logic, allow for remote publishing of articles, and use geolocation data to serve targeted content to users. The sky is the limit with custom plugins: if you can think it, I can build it.

## eCommerce Development

WordPress is a great choice for an online store. I have built dozens of sites on the WooCommerce platform ranging from sites that sell T-shirts to custom membership platforms. Because WordPress and WooCommerce are open source, it is easy to tailor the sites to my clients’ specific needs without having to worry about limitations of a closed platform (let alone high monthly fees).

## Site Performance Audits

WordPress is a powerful, dynamic platform that doesn’t always perform as quickly as expected. I can perform an in depth analysis of WordPress sites to identify performance bottlenecks at a code level to identify areas of improvement.

## Maintenance

I can also help with general maintenance tasks ranging from running updates to making design changes. I offer monthly maintenance plans and one-off projects depending on what my client’s needs are.
